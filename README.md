# Welcome to my code on Tkinter Login Menus!
You can download my work [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArzLkyiQ7nUs5ivbx8akRO7LcqRi?e=AZdIWV).

### What is my aim with this code?
Well, my aim is to make a secure, efficient login window using python's module Tkinter. This is a useful script for people starting off to see what Tkinter is and if you email me I can then show you how it is done.
